You must install the LWJGL package first in order to run the program 
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.9.3/).
This program represents an application of the use of the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL).
LWJGL is an open source library that allows cross platform access to native APIs graphics, audio, 
and parallel computing applications. This library is designated to create commercial-quality 
applications or games. For our program, we decided to replicate an online sketchpad where the user 
can freehand draw or make straight lines. 

Here are some user instructions:
 * Hold the left mouse button and drag for free hand drawing
 * CLick the left mouse button twice to draw a straight line
 * Click the right mouse button to start at a new location
 * Press space bar to clear the board
